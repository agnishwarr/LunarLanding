In this project, I created an AI to land a spaceship on the moon, using a method called Deep Q-Learning, which combines Q-Learning with a Neural Network. Instead of giving the spaceship set rules, it will learn on its own by figuring out the best actions to take. The Neural Network will predict the best actions based on the environment, and sometimes it will try random actions to explore and learn more. This project will show how AI can learn and master the challenge of lunar landing of spacecrafts.
